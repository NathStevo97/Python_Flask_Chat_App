# Python_Flask_Chat_App
This is a simple python application made for my own personal development
The app was made following the tutorial described here: https://codeburst.io/building-your-first-chat-application-using-flask-in-7-minutes-f98de4adfa5d

To run: run main.py, open two or more tabs at the IP address specified in the script and begin chatting.
